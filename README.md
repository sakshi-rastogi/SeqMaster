# SeqMaster: Comprehensive DNA Sequence Analysis Tool

This repository contains a Python-based tool designed for comprehensive analysis of DNA sequences. SeqMaster automates various analyses, including GC content calculation, reverse complement generation, motif searching, mutation detection, and more.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to provide a streamlined approach to analyzing DNA sequences for researchers and students in bioinformatics. The tool facilitates the following key tasks:

- **GC Content Calculation**: Calculate the GC content for single or multiple DNA sequences.
- **Reverse Complement Generation**: Generate the reverse complement of input DNA sequences.
- **Motif Searching**: Search for specific motifs within DNA sequences.
- **DNA Sequence Length and Base Composition**: Analyze the length of DNA sequences and their base composition.
- **Palindrome Detection**: Identify palindromic sequences in the DNA.
- **Mutation Detection**: Detect mutations between two DNA sequences.
- **DNA to Protein Translation**: Translate DNA sequences into their corresponding protein sequences.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive prompts guide users through various analyses.
- **Versatile Input Options**: Supports both manual sequence input and FASTA file uploads.
- **Automated Calculations**: Quick and accurate results for various DNA analyses.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify input sequences and parameters to fit specific research needs.

## Installation
To use SeqMaster, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install biopython

## Usage
